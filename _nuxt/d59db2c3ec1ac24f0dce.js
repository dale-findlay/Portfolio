It seemed as if it was magic, I felt like one of the game developers at Mojang it was great! But after adding some fun little things in, I quickly got bored of Minecraft and yearned for a bit more of a challenge."]},{title:"A New Foe Has Appeared",tldr:"I found C++ more challenging, making plenty of fun little console games trying desperately to get my head around things like pointers and such. Those experiences early on, while challenging were worth it in the end as I’ve only gotten better at the language. The same can’t be said for Java, but let’s are honest who needs java am I right? (throws years of java experience down the drain)",paragraphs:["It was at this point that I found out about C++ and that it was a bit more challenging than Java. After once again scouring tutorials online I found a few interesting ones and decided to make some little console applications which totally wowed my friends at school and slightly alarmed the teachers who weren’t technically knowledgeable. But C++ posed some real challenges, trying to get my head around memory management, understanding pointers and how they can be used effectively as well as all the syntax differences that came with C++ and trying to reconcile the differences between Java and C++. But eventually i got there, and almost 8 years later i can confidently say that those experiences were so worth it early on, as i've had plenty of time to fail since then and have only gotten better at the language.","Java is a different story, i'm not comfortable putting java on my resume despite using it for nearly two years but im sure if push came to shove it would all come back to me."]},{title:"Finding The Artist Within",tldr:"Programming on its own wasn’t scratching the creative itch, a teacher at school told me i was bad at drawing so I decided to give 3D modeling ago, being a student I had access to free Maya and 3ds Max and learned it, and now I would consider myself a Maya intermediate. But it still wasn’t quite enough to scratch the itch, I needed something to bring it all together.",paragraphs:["After experimenting with C++ it wasn't quite scratching the same itch that Minecraft mods were, they presented an almost equally artistic and technical challenge and was basically a perfect match for my personality. After trying with CAD in various forms and after I found out that I was terrible at drawing in real life from an art teacher who wrote something to the effect of “you’re the worst in the class”, ouch. I wouldn't be deterred from some art teacher, so I decided to check out 3D modeling. Luckily enough, still being a student I could get access to 3DS Max and Maya for Free! Finally, something that scratched the creative itch, but something was still missing. While doing these things separately was fun and all, I wanted something to bring it all together."]},{title:"The Answer I Was Always Looking For",tldr:"I was introduced to UDK (Unreal Development Kit) and it inspired me to create plenty of crappy demos and games. I wanted to try out Unreal Engine 4 (when it was released), thanks to some awesome folks at Epic I secured a license key only for it to become permanently free a month later. Unreal Engine 4 similarly inspired me to get better and build better and better things.",paragraphs:["It was thanks to the magic of timing and luck - something I'm still yet to understand about the mystery of the universe, UDK came along, I’d heard in one of the videos I'd been watching on C++ that Epic Games had a free version of unreal engine 3 that anyone can use. I was like wow, this is awesome, after playing games like BioShock (which was made in unreal engine 3), I figured I might be able to create a game like that! Obviously thanks to the naivety of any new game developer I failed miserably. Over, and over, and over again. But each time getting slightly better. It was at which point being thoroughly invested in UDK that Unreal Engine 4 came along. ","A revolutionary new jump in visual quality and crazy jump in ‘ease of use’ thanks to blueprints and such. However, there was just one problem. It wasn’t free. On the upside, they had an indie program, so I put together a bit of a pitch for a game and submitted it. A few weeks later expecting a small discount or some kind of deal, I got an email from one Jay Wilbur with a short message about how cool the project sounded and a free unreal engine 4 license key. Shoutout to Jay, I think without that I might have given up on games all together.","But downloading Unreal Engine 4 and being wowed by the amazing new interface and crazy lighting and default settings as well as all the epic starter content. I tell you, it's the most visceral feeling I've ever had in my journey to this day."]},{title:"There Can Be Nothing Without Unity",tldr:"I wanted to be able to use more than one engine, unity popped up and I gave it a go. Now I would consider my ability on par with my ability in Unreal. But I needed some qualifications if I was gonna make a move on this whole Game development thing so I decided to start small with the Advanced Diploma.",paragraphs:["But of course, as being a mono-lingual engineer in the software industry is a significant downside, being an expert in one engine and having no understanding of any other is just as significant. But luckily Unity, a free engine once again by the mysteriousness of the universe, found its way into my life. This one is significantly easier to learn (given my experiences up to this point) but still an interesting challenge. I made some small little game demos (similar to when I first learnt UDK). And after a few short years of use, I had a pretty good grasp of it - similar ability anyway to Unreal Engine. But I needed some qualifications if I was gonna get anywhere and I thought best to start small."]},{title:"Advanced Diploma of Game Programming",tldr:"The course was very challenging both personally, and dealing with a significant failure. Overall, it was great experience and very worthwhile in learning experiences. There’s a lot to unpack with these 3 years, Get in touch if you’re interested in more info.",paragraphs:["I decided in early 2015 that I wanted to start an Advanced Diploma in Game Development specializing in game programming. The course ended up being quite long going from December 2016 to March 2019 and was also very expensive. ","We used Unity heaps, I say we but I really mean I because most of the designers and artists didn’t complete their unity classes until very late in the course, so as the programmer I was stuck importing everything in the engine and pulling it all together.","But alas, I learnt many things and met some awesome folks. Something I would love to direct your attention to is a particular project called Frantic Food Frenzy. I would regard this project objectively as a complete failure. And it’s one of my key reference points for what can go wrong in a project. Here’s a link to the full story of the project. But the TLDR of that is that we were doing really well but due to lack of creative leadership (a limitation imposed by the teachers), the project ended up falling way off track. And suffice to say its a terrible game now.","I could write ad nauseam about what happened and what I learned, but I’d be here for a while. Send me an email if you’re interested in hearing more.","The course was a real challenge, but overcoming that and moving forward were big moments for me. Ways of consolidating my experiences and looking back. Despite the length and the cost, it was an overall good experience. And by the way, the cost was $45000+ - so yeah that’s cool."]},{title:"Business #1 - Red Wild",tldr:"I started a business with some folks from the Advanced Diploma and a friend as a business partner.

But unfortunately, after a year in pre-production for our game, it wasn’t viable to continue; the team was put under too much pressure and the partner wasn't able to contribute to the project only on a financial level so I decided to close down the partnership and pivot back to a basic job to earn some more money to give it another crack."]}],tldr:!1}},methods:{ToggleTLDR:function(){this.tldr=!this.tldr}}},r=n(14),component=Object(r.a)(o,(function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",{staticClass:"container"},[o("div",{staticClass:"row"},[o("div",{staticClass:"col-md-3 text-center"},[o("img",{staticClass:"img-fluid",staticStyle:{"max-height":"300px"},attrs:{src:n(187),alt:""}})]),e._v(" "),e._m(0)]),e._v(" "),o("section",{staticClass:"mt-4"},[o("h1",[e._v("My Experience in Games")]),e._v(" "),e.tldr?e._e():o("div",[o("p",{staticClass:"font-weight-bold"},[e._v("I wanted to be as verbose as possible here so click the 'View TLDR; Version' button for a shorter version.")]),e._v(" "),o("button",{staticClass:"btn btn-outline-primary",on:{click:function(t){return e.ToggleTLDR()}}},[e._v("View TLDR; Version")])]),e._v(" "),!0===e.tldr?o("div",[o("p",{staticClass:"font-weight-bold d-block"},[e._v("You're viewing the TLDR; version, click the 'View Full Version' button to view the full version.")]),e._v(" "),o("button",{staticClass:"btn btn-outline-primary",on:{click:function(t){return e.ToggleTLDR()}}},[e._v("View Full Version")])]):e._e(),e._v(" "),o("hr"),e._v(" "),e._l(e.experiences,(function(t){return o("div",[o("h3",[e._v(e._s(t.title))]),e._v(" "),e._l(t.paragraphs,(function(t){return e.tldr?e._e():o("p",[e._v(e._s(t))])})),e._v(" "),!0===e.tldr?o("p",[e._v("\n        "+e._s(t.tldr)+"\n      ")]):e._e()],2)})),e._v(" "),o("hr"),e._v(" "),o("h3",{staticClass:"font-weight-bold"},[e._v("Present Day")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Those are all the key moments in my life up to this point that I credit my experience and expertise too.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("If you want to know more about anything in particular please feel free to send me an email, im leaving out much of the crazy stuff here because this would just be way longer than it already is.
